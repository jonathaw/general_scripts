use:

translate_all.bash < my sequences, in 2nd column  >

this scripts calls the otherscripts in this folder. Since it currently doesnt use an 
absolute path, you have to copy all scripts into your folder. or define an
absolute path under translate all....

make_dnaworksinput.bash makes a simple text file that gets read by dnaworks.
here change which expression host to use. their webpage has the namings. 

getseq_from_dnaworks.bash extracts the info from the DNAworks output. update, now it uses
getSeq.pl instead, which works best for all varying lenghts.

combine* puts all sequences into 1 big fasta file
